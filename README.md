A tranquil puzzle game where you match stones to build your tiny island with all the comforts of the Middle Ages.

The game was tested to work on (in order of immersiveness):

- Meta Quest (2) VR & AR
- Oculus Go
- Desktop
- Android mobile (preferrably on a tablet)

To rotate the model:

- On desktop use mouse-drag
- On Meta Quest use thumbsticks
- On Oculus Go use the trackpad
